# Moser's Game of Life

## Overview
A modern implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. This project simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of simple rules, resulting in complex emergent behaviors.

## Rules of the Game
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
